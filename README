NOTE: Starting with the version 0.9.0-pre1 Piddle sources are shipped together with
BKChem. Piddle is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead
at least 2 years. Therefore it was decided to put it inside BKChem sources and
distribute any eventual additions this way. In case any major changes will be made
Piddle will be released as a standalone library.

NOTE: Starting with the version 0.10.0-pre1 Pmw (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/)
sources (version 1.2) are shipped together with BKChem.
There were needed some minor fixes in Pwm and as it is a library provided under the
GPL license and seems to be dead it was decided to put it inside bkchem sources and
distribute the fixed version this way.

NOTE: The official InChI software from IUPAC is bundled in a binary form together
with BKChem in Windows binary builds. All the credit for this nice piece of
software goes to its creators.
