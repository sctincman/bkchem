This piece of software is an unofficial fork of BKChem, 
which is a free molecular drawing program.

For the official version, more info on program capabilities, install instructions etc.
see documentation in directory "doc" in the main BKChem directory or the BKChem
website on http://zirael.org/bkchem/

NOTE: Starting with the version 0.9.0-pre1 Piddle sources are shipped together with
BKChem. Piddle is a library provided under the GPL license and seems to be dead
at least 2 years. Therefore it was decided to put it inside BKChem sources and
distribute any eventual additions this way. In case any major changes will be made
Piddle will be released as a standalone library.

NOTE: Starting with the version 0.10.0-pre1 Pmw (http://pmw.sourceforge.net/)
sources (version 1.2) are shipped together with BKChem.
There were needed some minor fixes in Pwm and as it is a library provided under the
GPL license and seems to be dead it was decided to put it inside bkchem sources and
distribute the fixed version this way.

NOTE: The official InChI software from IUPAC is bundled in a binary form together
with BKChem in Windows binary builds. All the credit for this nice piece of
software goes to its creators.
